The eigenfaces model and database is created in Matlab and saved on matlab format on the SD card. The app during start up reads this file sets up all the required matrices. User is provided an interface to take a picture and that pictures is matched with the database based on eigenfaces algorithm.
Some part of code (preprocessing idea) is taken from Sriadibhatla\_Davo\_Chao FaceRecognition project. http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee368/Project_10/

You can look at the project report here. http://mason.gmu.edu/~kbhattar/files/PR_FaceRecognitionUsingEigenfaces.pdf

This was used for GMU college project.
